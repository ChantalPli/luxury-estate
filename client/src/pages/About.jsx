      <p>Launched in November 2011, LuxuryEstate is a site dedicated to those who wish to purchase or rent a luxury home, along with those who are passionate about prestigious real estate and curious to discover new trends and interior solutions. Whether itâ€™s a castle in Loire, an apartment in London, a villa in Tuscany or a penthouse in New York, LuxuryEstate has the largest selection of luxury homes to offer in the most chic and renowned places in the world.

        At times real estate can be a part of our history, at times inspirations from new architectural elements, or at other times simply beautiful examples of how you can transform a space with the right interior design choices.

        Whatever the reason may be that people search amongst the luxury homes advertised on LuxuryEstate, we want to offer you the best experience possible. Whether you are attracted by the beauty of the properties, the inspiration from browsing listings, the desire to purchase a dream home or make an investment. Whether online or on our apps for smartphone and tablet.

        The world is vast, with many languages, and each country has their own diverse culture. Nevertheless, scanning through our listings you will discover two corresponding elements: the importance of what we call home and the idea of beauty.
